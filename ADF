Create row hash fingerprint
Use this code in your data flow script to create a new derived column called DWhash that produces a sha1 hash of three columns.


Copy
derive(DWhash = sha1(Name,ProductNumber,Color)) ~> DWHash
You can also use this script below to generate a row hash using all columns that are present in your stream, without needing to name each column:

derive(DWhash = sha1(Name,ProductNumber,Color)) ~> DWHash
